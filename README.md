# NOTE-TAKER-2000

## Description

NOTE TAKER 2000 is an application that writes and saves notes. After the user clicks Get Started on the welcome page it takes them to a second page where it welcomes user input for notes consisting of a title and comments and saves it forever, which is a really long time. This app uses JSON, fs, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and API routes.
